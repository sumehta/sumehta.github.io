<!-- 
Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I'm an AI research scientist and engineer. I've done research in NLP (large language models, machine translation, and information extraction), graph ml (representation learning), recommender systems and HCI (crowdsourcing). Most recently I was at Bloomberg working on training large language models for customer support systems. Before that I was a research scientist at Twitter working on recommendation systems.

I graduated with a PhD from the Data Mining Group at Virginia Tech, where I had the privilege to be advised by [Dr. Naren Ramakrishnan](https://people.cs.vt.edu/naren/). I was also fortunate enough to have had my PhD studies funded by both an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship and a DARPA Research Grant. Before that I spent time hacking crowd+AI systems with [Dr. Kurt Luther](https://crowd.cs.vt.edu/kurt-luther/).

My research proposal was accepted to be awarded a [Twitch Research Fellowship](https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2020/01/15/introducing-our-2020-twitch-research-fellows/) in 2020. In the past I've spent time at Netflix working on improving deep machine translation models for subtitles and making movies at Dreamworks Animation.
