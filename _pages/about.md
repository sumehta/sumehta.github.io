I'm an AI research scientist and engineer. I've done research in NLP (large language models, machine translation, and information extraction), graph ml (representation learning), recommender systems and HCI (crowdsourcing). Currently, I work on LLM post-training at Meta for ARVR devices such as Rayban Meta Smart Glasses and Quest. In the past, I have worked on building recommender systems for global social networks such as Twitter & TikTok.

I graduated with a PhD from the Data Mining Group at Virginia Tech, where I had the privilege to be advised by [Dr. Naren Ramakrishnan](https://people.cs.vt.edu/naren/). I was also fortunate enough to have had my PhD studies funded by both an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship and a DARPA Research Grant. Before that I spent time developing crowd+AI systems with [Dr. Kurt Luther](https://crowd.cs.vt.edu/kurt-luther/).

My research proposal was accepted to be awarded a [Twitch Research Fellowship](https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2020/01/15/introducing-our-2020-twitch-research-fellows/) in 2020. In the past I've spent time at Netflix working on improving deep machine translation models for subtitles and making movies at Dreamworks Animation.
